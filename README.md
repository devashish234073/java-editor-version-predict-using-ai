# java-editor-version-predict-using-ai

This app requires ollama to be installed on your machine from ollama.com and get any model from there.

I am using llama3.2 by running this command 
```
ollama run llama3.2:3b
```

After getting the model clone this repo and do npm install and npm start.
```
git clone https://github.com/devashish234073/imaginary-programming-language-using-ai
cd imaginary-programming-language-using-ai
npm install
npm start
```

Access teh application on http://localhost:9999
